## About
Meme My Text is a simple web app intended to consolidate some of the most commonly used text manipulations when joking around online. I got tired of having to go to vaguely sketchy looking websites to do these manipulations so decided to build a tool for myself.

## How to use

Manipulating text is easy. Simply select the desired text manipulation from the dropdown menu and then type or paste the desired text into the input box. From here all you need to do is click the button labelled **"Meme Text and Copy!"** in order for your text to be automaticaly conerted and copied to the clipboard for pasting.

## Available manipulations

The following text manipulations are currently available in **Meme My Text**:

* **Random Capitalization** - Takes each character and randomly changes its type case. **e.g. SaMPLe texT**

* **Binary** - Converts the text to binary. **e.g. 1110011 1100001 1101101 1110000 1101100 1100101 100000 1110100 1100101 1111000 1110100**

* **Vaporwave** - Converts the text to the uppercase, spaced out format typically associated with vaporwave music. **e.g. S A M P L E   T E X T**

* **Reverse** - Reverses the order of characters in the text. **e.g. txet elpmas**
